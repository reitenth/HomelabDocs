# HomelabDocs

This repo is the home of my docs for all things in my homelab that I want referenced. 

I use [Github Wiki](https://github.com/reitenth/HomelabDocs/wiki) for all my doc needs, to have version control and be hosted easily off of my server. 

My current docker compose files can be found [here](https://github.com/reitenth/HomelabDocs/tree/main/docker).
